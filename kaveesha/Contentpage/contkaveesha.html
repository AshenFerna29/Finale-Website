                    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
                    <p>Food security and nutrition have been two critical global challenges that remain very challenging issues in the present era for several reasons. The world has faced considerable setbacks due to the COVID-19 pandemic, while now, due to the war in Ukraine, this has further exacerbated already existing vulnerabilities in the markets of food and energy. The pandemic plunged the world into recession, wiped out three decades of improvement in poverty reduction, and almost added 90 million more people to hunger between 2019 and 2020. There were signs of recovery in 2021, although still partial and uneven across countries and more so in lower- and middle-income countries. The war in Ukraine confused commodity and energy markets between two of the world's big agricultural producers, a development spilling over much uncertainty at an already very fragile recovery. Against such a backdrop, therefore, it points out that continuous efforts are needed toward the realisation of SDG 2: Zero hunger; ending hunger, ensuring access to food that is safe, nutritious, and sufficient for everybody; and ending all forms of malnutrition by 2030.</p>

                    <h2>FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION AROUND THE WORLD</h2>
                    <p>This edition shows the global situation on food security and nutrition in 2022—still a world reeling from a pandemic, now reeling even further from the war in Ukraine that shook the already rattled markets of food and energy. The COVID-19 pandemic has taken its devastating toll on both lives and livelihoods, generating global economic recession that shut down three decades of global progress in poverty reduction and contributing to the estimate of an added close to 90 million people suffering from hunger in just one year from 2019 to 2020. The recovery continued into the year 2021 but remained very partial and highly uneven across and within countries, with much slower recovery in lower-and middle-income nations. Disadvantaged segments of the population everywhere were still struggling to recover the income losses incurred at the peak of the pandemic the previous year. This added about 38 million to the projected increase in the number of people facing hunger in 2021. Then, when finally the weight of the pandemic began to lift—in February 2022—the war in Ukraine erupted. The war was between two of the world's major agricultural producers. It shocked commodity and energy markets, weakening an already weak recovery and adding many times more uncertainty to it.
                        Using an assessment of the state of food security and nutrition in 2022, the backdrop remains one of a still slow, uneven recovery from the pandemic, coupled with global spillovers due to the war in Ukraine. While showing much hope for economic recovery from the pandemic and projections of poverty and hunger are expected to decline, there had been rising prices of food and agricultural inputs and energy. The current chapter is devoted to an annual update of the trends and perspectives in food security and nutrition at the global level up to 2022 and a progress report toward the achievement of SDG 2, focusing specifically on SDG targets 2.1 and 2.2: ending hunger and ensuring that all people—in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations—have access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food all year round; and ending all forms of malnutrition by 2030.</p>

                    <h2>CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON FOOD SECURITY</h2>
                    <p>Climate change is strongly affecting the conditions under which agriculture is practiced. In all parts of the world, plants, animals and ecosystems are adapted to the climatic conditions that prevail there. If these change, even slightly, even in a direction that may appear more favorable, the plants and animals that are present will be affected, some will become less productive, or even disappear. Some are easily predictable, like the direct consequences a heat wave will have on some definite kind of plant at some definite moment of its growth, provided it has been well known and studied enough. Others, because of the different ways each element will react and the interaction with the others, are difficult to predict, as would be the case of the effect of some climatic change on an ecosystem. For example, many cultivated plants are responsive—a desirable trait—in controlled conditions to increased atmospheric CO2. At the same time, so are many weeds. A result in the field can be an increase or decrease, according to weeds competing for nutriments, water, and remedial agricultural practices in the yield of the cultivated plant. In this way, pests and diseases will move to places that are institutionally and biologically much less prepared for them, with possibly higher negative impacts expected. These supplementary risks on agricultural production immediately translate into supplementary risks for food safety and nutrition among people who directly depend on agriculture for food and their livelihood. They can also have an impact on the food security and nutrition of faraway populations through price volatility and disrupted trade. There is thus a cascade of risks from climate changes to agroecosystems, to agricultural production, to economic and social consequences, and finally to food security and nutrition. In this first chapter, there will be mentioned multiple links through which climate change impacts on food security and nutrition. Knowledge about climate change itself is initial, focused on recent knowledge improvements that are of major interest for the agricultural sectors. Some of the main known impacts on crops, livestock, forestry, fisheries, and aquaculture will then be briefly recalled. Section three is dedicated to analyzing the economic and social consequences on agricultural production. The fourth section brings together vulnerabilities—biophysical, social, and institutional—to understand better the links leading from climate change to negative impacts on food security and nutrition, with a view to being able to identify means to address them. And finally, the fifth section gives insight into how these translate into impacts on food security and nutrition in its four dimensions.</p>

                    <h2>COCLUSION</h2>
                    <p>In summary, the global situation on food security and nutrition in 2022 is one where recovery from the pandemic is slow and uneven, and additional pressures arising from the war in Ukraine are emerging. Climate change presents a further risk to agricultural productivity, so to food security and nutrition, both directly through propitious plant growth conditions and indirectly via increased incidence of pests and pathogens, as well as economic and social disruptions. Reducing food losses and waste is paramount to improving food security. Food production contributes towards climate change through associated greenhouse gas emissions. Handling these multi-dimensional challenges will require holistic redressal measures to enhance food system efficiency, buttress vulnerable populations against food insecurity, adjust to climate change, and adopt policies aimed at lessening food loss and food waste. Of importance to building resilient food systems, such efforts have a place in ensuring that all people at all times have access to adequate, safe, and nutritious food.</p>
